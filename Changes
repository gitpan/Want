		-A Want
	- Published to CPAN on 2001-07-15

	- Give correct expectation count for constructs like
		my ($x, $y, $z) = (23, foo());   # foo's expectation count is 2
	- want(2) should be true in C<@x = foo()> etc;
	  i.e. infinity > N for any finite N  :-)
	- Support '!' negative requests
	- correct expectation count for slices
