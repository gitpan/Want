		-A Want
	- Published to CPAN on 2001-07-15

	- Give correct expectation count for constructs like
		my ($x, $y, $z) = (23, foo());   # foo's expectation count is 2
	- want(2) should be true in C<@x = foo()> etc;
	  i.e. infinity > N for any finite N  :-)
	- Support '!' negative requests
	- correct expectation count for slices

	- Fix documentation snafus
	- add want('COUNT') as a synonym for C<howmany>
	  and want('REF') for C<wantref>
	- BOOLEAN context
	- now compiles & passes tests under ithreads
	- SCALARREF and OBJECT reference contexts
	  (want('REF') eq 'SCALAR' || want('REF') eq 'OBJECT')
	- Reorganised test suite

	- 'want' is now exported by default
	- BOOL is a euphemism for BOOLEAN (Perl 6 compatibility)
	- ARGUMENTS section added to documentation
	- excised C++-style comments from the source
	- fixed the expectation count issue from the BUGS section of 0.03
	- ASSIGN context. Yeah, baby!
	- don't throw an error if RVALUE/LVALUE are used from a non-lvalue sub
	- specifiers can also now be space-separated, e.g.:
		want('LVALUE ASSIGN');
